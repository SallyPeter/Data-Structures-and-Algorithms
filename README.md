# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repo would be where I share my understanding and recreation of Data structures and Algorithms. It is open for suggestions and collaborations.

Code Files present in this repo would share 

- Linked Lists : Linked Lists are data structures where each element considered here as a node contains its data and a pointer to the next. This data structure is most efficient in use cases where insertion and deletion are prioritized. The time complexity is O(1) for these cases despite the length od the list. Linked Lists are not efficient for Indexing and Search use cases due to its time complexity of O(n).
- Stacks : Stacks are a data structure which operated on the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Hence, operations requiring this order would be well optimized using the stack data structure. The time complexity of the stack for inserting and deleting an element is constant O(1) while searching or poping the Nth element takes O(N). This is because all the elements preceeding the element of choice has to be popped or accessed before the element of choice. The space complexity on the other hand take O(1) since no additional spacce is required for any operation.
- Queue : Queues allow for insertion is done at one end and deletion from the other end as against the Stack which allows for both operations from same end. The Queue operates on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The time complexity of both inserting and deleting is O(1) while the time complexity for accessing and searching for an element is O(N).
- Deque (or Dequeue) : This in my opinion is a classic combination of both the Stack and the Queue. It combines the best of both structures allowing for insertion and deletion operations to occur at any end. The time complexity for searching and inserting of an element is O(N) where N is the closest distance to the element/position of choice from either of the ends. Over time it is expected that all operations on a deque should be O(1).
