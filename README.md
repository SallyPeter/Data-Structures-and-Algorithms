# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repo would be where I share my understanding and recreation of Data structures and Algorithms. It is open for suggestions and collaborations.

Code Files present in this repo would share 
- Linked Lists : Linked Lists are data structures where each element considered here as a node contains its data and a pointer to the next. This data structure is most efficient in use cases where insertion and deletion are prioritized. The time complexity is O(1) for these cases despite the length od the list. Linked Lists are not efficient for Indexing and Search use cases due to its time complexity of O(n).
- Stacks
- Queue
- would keep adding
